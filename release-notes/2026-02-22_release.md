## New Pages

### Roadmap Process (`/roadmap-process`)
A visualization page explaining how roadmap priorities are developed:

**Roadmap Prioritization Section**
- Interactive funnel diagram showing the five input lanes that feed roadmap priorities:
  - New Revenue
  - Retention
  - Acquisition Integration
  - Innovation & Competitiveness
  - Platform Health
- Animated lane cards with icons and descriptions
- Visual funnel effect showing inputs combining into roadmap priorities

**PRP Process Section**
- Product Request Project (PRP) workflow visualization
- Status flow diagram showing request progression:
  - New → CS/Revenue Review → CS/Revenue Qualify → Ready for Product
  - Product Review → Reviewed → Scheduled → In Development → Completed
  - Terminal states: On Hold, Won't Do
- Hover tooltips on each status with definitions
- Color-coded status categories (Entry, CS/Revenue, Product, Active, Terminal)

**Priority Scoring Algorithm Section**
- Visual explanation of ARR-based priority calculation
- Weight breakdown: 60% Priority, 40% ARR Score
- ARR tier explanations ($5M+, $1M-$5M, $500K-$1M, <$500K)
- Priority point system (Critical=4, High=3, Medium=2, Low=1)
- Note about pipeline revenue evaluation for new revenue requests

### Presentation Builder (`/presentation-builder`)
A new tool for creating presentations from app content:

**Features**
- **Title slide generation**: Branded title slide with presentation name and date
- **Section headers**: Each slide includes a header bar with section name
- **Content selection**: Checkbox UI to select pages and sections to include
- **PDF export**: Captures content via hidden iframe loading
- **Progress indicator**: Shows capture progress during export

**Export Mode**
- Pages render differently when captured for export (`?export=true`):
  - Acquisition descriptions show full text (no truncation)
  - Technical Integration uses wider columns for full names
  - Acquisition Tracker cards are always expanded

---

## Updated Pages

### Acquisition Tracker (`/acquisition-tracker`)
- **Dynamic export sections**: Each acquisition with progress data is now its own exportable section
- **Export mode support**: Cards stay expanded, full content visible
- Added `useSearchParams` for export mode detection

### Acquisition List (`/acquisitions`)
- **Export mode support**: Full descriptions shown without truncation
- Added `useSearchParams` for export mode detection

### Technical Integration (`/technical-integration`)
- **Export mode support**: 
  - Wider row labels (400px vs 280px)
  - Wider columns (180px vs 160px)
  - No text truncation on acquisition/project names
- Added `useSearchParams` for export mode detection

---

## New Features

### Export Content System
A new React context and hook system for registering exportable content:

- **ExportContentContext** (`context/export-content-context.tsx`):
  - Manages registry of exportable pages and sections
  - Provides `registerPage`, `registerSection` callbacks
  - Handles section ordering and page grouping

- **Export Section Registration**:
  - Pages register themselves and their exportable sections on mount
  - Sections include: id, name, description, order, and DOM element reference
  - Data attributes (`data-export-section="section-id"`) mark capture targets

### Granular Export Sections
Content split into targeted exportable pieces:
- **Roadmap Process**: 
  - Roadmap Prioritization (funnel + lanes)
  - PRP Process Workflow
  - Priority Scoring Algorithm
- **Acquisition Tracker**: Each acquisition is a separate section
- **Technical Integration**: Full timeline view
- **Acquisition List**: Full grid view

---
